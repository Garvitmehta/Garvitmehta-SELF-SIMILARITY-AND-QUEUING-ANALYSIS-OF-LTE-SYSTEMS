\chapter{Future Work}

In the future we will focus on two tasks mainly:-

1) We will be simulating the M/M/1 queuing model in the context of simple LTE Networks. For this we will be using NS3 simulator which is a discrete-event network simulator for Internet systems. We will check various performance metrics such as packet loss, delay, throughput etc of a particular network topology and confirm if they are indeed following the above model characteristics.\\

2) We will take a more appropriate model called NBurst/M/1 model on a different LTE network topology. Firstly, We will define an appropriate network topology and then an ON time distribution $X_{ON}$, and simulate the network to check the performance metrics analytically. We will again use NS3 simulator for this taking appropriate assumptions wherever necessary to check the Network 's characteristic properties such as throughput,packet loss,packet delay, block probability,etc.
